New version of petnames db/rails app 7/26/15

A Ruby on Rails app using a Mysql database.

A collection of petnames with a page that lists all names (no duplicates), a page that lists all breeds (no duplicates), and a page 
that lists all individual animals with name, breed, dates of existence, and notes. Name, breed and individuals have clickable links.

"Breed" is used loosely and may refer to a species' common name, such as cat or seal.
